## Pandas Kids Drawings 
This data contains children's drawings (each child drew about 22 drawings). <br>
Each drawing has a CSV file and an image of the drawing that also contains the original drawing that the child was asked to draw. <br>

We had to perform the following four tasks (per drawing):
* Count the number of hand lifts.
* Count the amount of lines.
* Measure the length and the average pressure applied to each line.
* Determine whether a shape is open or closed (only in specific shape).
